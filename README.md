# Book-Recommendation-System
This project is a Book Recommendation System that leverages collaborative filtering and machine learning techniques to recommend books. By using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model, this system analyzes reader preferences, based on user ratings, to recommend books that closely match similar user profiles.
