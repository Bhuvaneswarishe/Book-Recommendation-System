# Book-Recommendation-System
This project is a Book Recommendation System that leverages collaborative filtering and machine learning techniques to recommend books. By using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model, this system analyzes reader preferences, based on user ratings, to recommend books that closely match similar user profiles.
Key Features

    Collaborative Filtering: Identifies user groups with similar reading habits to provide personalized recommendations.
    K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Finds the closest neighbors to the user's profile using rating data, focusing on relevant similarities.
    Pivot-based Approach: Transforms book ratings into a user-book matrix for optimal recommendation generation.

How It Works

1.Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares book rating data for model input.
2.Model Training: Uses KNN for collaborative filtering to identify books rated highly by similar users.
3.Recommendation Generation: Provides users with book suggestions based on similar user preferences, offering 
4.personalized recommendations.

Technologies Used

    1.Python for scripting and data processing
    2.Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
    3.Scikit-learn for KNN and collaborative filtering
    4.Streamlit for an interactive user interface (if applicable)
